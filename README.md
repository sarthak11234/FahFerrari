# 🏎️ Ferrari F1 "Next Year™" Predictor

> *"We are checking..."* - Every Ferrari Engineer ever.

Welcome to the **Ferrari F1 Predictor**, the only piece of software more reliable than the SF-25's power unit. This advanced AI system attempts the impossible: predicting when Ferrari will finally win another championship (spoiler: it's always "next year").

## 🧐 What is this?

This is a machine learning project that analyzes historical data to generate predictions for the 2026 season, because let's face it, we've already given up on the current one. It features:

*   **Analysis Engine**: Crunches numbers harder than a wheel gun stripping a wheel nut at a pit stop.
*   **Chatbot Strategist**: An AI assistant that simulates the authentic Ferrari strategy experience. If you ask if we'll win, it claims telemetry is down. (It's a feature, not a bug).
*   **Performance Metrics**: Tracks driver stats, reliability scores, and the exact probability of a trusted strategy call actually working.

## 🚀 Features

-   **2026 Crystal Ball**: Uses XGBoost, Random Forest, and a hint of delusion to forecast the 2026 constructor standings.
-   **Driver Therapy**: Compare Hamilton's regret levels vs. Leclerc's patience reserves.
-   **Authentic Simulation**: The API occasionally throws a 500 error just to simulate an engine failure in Q3.
-   **Race-by-Race Grief Model**: Predicts exactly which lap the strategy team will pit for Hards on a wet track.

## 🛠️ Installation

1.  **Clone the repository**
    (Try not to copy Red Bull's aero concept 2 years too late)
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/ferrari-f1-predictor.git
    cd ferrari-f1-predictor
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies**
    (Unlike our upgrades, these actually work)
    ```bash
    # Create valid environment
    python -m venv venv
    .\venv\Scripts\activate
    
    # Install
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3.  **Run the Backend**
    (Faster than a pit stop under Mattia Binotto)
    ```bash
    python -m api.app
    ```

4.  **Start the Frontend**
    ```bash
    cd frontend
    npm install
    npm run dev
    ```

## 🎮 Usage

Open `http://localhost:5173` and ask the chatbot:
*   *"Will we win in 2026?"*
*   *"Compare 2024 (Plan A) and 2025 (Plan F)"*
*   *"Why is the hard tyre working?"* (It won't answer this, nobody knows).

## 🤝 Contributing

Pull requests are welcome. If you find a bug, please label it as "Strategy Error" and we will ignore it until the end of the season.
